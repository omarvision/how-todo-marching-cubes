# how-todo-marching-cubes
Haven't made a video in a while. That's because this marching cubes algorithm took me awhile to unravel. Most of the work was in the 256 cube configurations and the isofaces it takes to build them.  I figured them all out myself (even though there were probably daat available on internet somewhere).  Oh well, learn the hard way, and I'll never forget.  In this video I'll go over how the marching cube algorithm works, how to use it, how to figure out the cube configurations.  You'll see it animated in action. There is a cube configurator scene that helps you see what each cube configuration looks like.  the MarchingCube.cs file is reusable so you don't have to write it everytime you start a new game project.
